# FF8

This is my own personal collection of FF research and mayhem. 
I don't expect it to be overly fruitful. 
I do however, always want to share my findings. 


To Do!

* pingvals research finds that the RNG manipulation for Carawat Code and Final Party manip are linked to both Air Soldier & Ruby Dragon.
  with this information at hand, I need to figure out how to convert the values he has to be useful on PC to investigate further.
  
Below are the addresses in the Japanese version:

Random number generation subroutine
0x800382e8
Save destination of random number state (4 bytes)
0x8005510c
Value used as a field random number (1 byte)
0x8005510e


* Complete my encounter caluclator in it's entirety. 
  It works right now as a nice cross reference tool. If I can integrate wiht Brofar's list of ENC formataion IDs somehow;
  I could predict every single possible encoutner without having to 'physically' test them.
  This would be invaluable in routing.
  
 
* Tied along with routing from previous point; I may need to find a distance between values that would naturally cause the 4th formation.
  This would be very important to potentially: 
                                                Get bats in Fire Cavern,
                                                Get 3 Soldiers on Bridge in Dollet
                                                (Potentially get a haste draw in Prison)
                                                Esthar Encounters.
